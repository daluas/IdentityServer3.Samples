Hi daluas,

I have noticed that you have been having the same problem as us which is the intermittent "No signin id passed" error when using ADFS.
I am reaching out to you like this because this seems the only way to contact someone on GitHub.

You posted about it in:

https://github.com/IdentityServer/IdentityServer3/issues/1052

and

https://github.com/IdentityServer/IdentityServer3/issues/1416

This is very frustrating for us and we have been trying to solve it for nearly a year and we can't work out how to fix it. It only happens intermittently.

I would be very grateful if you could tell us whether you were able to resolve this problem for your situation or not.

We have actually discovered why it was happening and we have solved the issue so we can help you solve this issue too now.

It was to do with a bug in IdentityServer 3 where if a request comes in using the wrong case (uppercase/lowercase path) after an App Pool recycle, IdentityServer will use this wrong cookie path in future login requests and therefore all logins will fail.

I can be reached on: martin.klusacek@frontiersoftware.com.au

Thank you very much,

Martin
